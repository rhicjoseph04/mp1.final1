              Ingredients Shop this Recipe
              Starter (poolish)

              1/2 cup (113g) water, cool
              1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) active dry yeast or instant yeast*
              1 cup (120g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*
              *Substitute 1 tablespoon (25g) healthy sourdough starter (fed or unfed) for the yeast, if desired.

              Dough

              1 cup + 2 tablespoons (255g) water, lukewarm
              all of the starter
              1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
              3 1/2 cups (420g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*
              2 teaspoons (12g) salt
            </p>
            <h4>Our Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a
                large bowl, combine the starter ingredients.
              </li>
              <li>
                To make the starter: Mix everything together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room
                temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become
                bubbly.
              <li>
                To make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough
                cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit
                rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a
                KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise
                for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the
                bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.

              </li>
              <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three
                equal pieces. </li>
              <li>Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased
                plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to 1 hour, if that works better with your schedule.
              </li>
              <li>Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in
                half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.</li>
              <li>Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough
                should have started to elongate itself.</li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16" log. Your goal is a 15"
                baguette, so 16" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of
                the log slightly to create the baguette's typical "pointy" end.

              </li>
              <li>Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the
                folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap,
                and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy ("marshmallow-y" is the term we use in our
                baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them,
                but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room
                temperature (about 68°F).</li>
              <li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a cast iron pan on the floor of
                the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to
                heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.</li>
              <li>If your baguettes have risen in a dish towel or couche, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a
                transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of parchment, seam-side down. If you don't have a
                transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the
                parchment on a baking sheet. </li>
              <li>Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make
                three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.

              </li>
              <li>Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the
                baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron
                pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the
                baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.</li>
              <li>
                Bake the baguettes — on the pan, or on a stone — for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're a very deep
                golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes,
                turn off the oven, crack it open about 2", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until
                both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.
              </li>
              <li>Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage.
                Thaw and reheat just before serving.

            <h4>Recipe</h4>

            <p>
              <h4>What Is a Turnover?</h4>
              A turnover is a triangular filled pastry that looks a little bit like a hand pie. It's made by filling
              pastry dough, folding and sealing the edges, and baking. Turnovers can be sweet or savory. Oftentimes,
              dessert turnovers are drizzled with a sweet glaze or sprinkled with powdered sugar.
              <h4> Apple Turnover </h4>
              Ingredients
              <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>

                <li> 1 cup brown sugar</li>

                <li> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

                <li> 1 tablespoon water</li>

                <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>

                <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>

                <li> 1 tablespoon milk</li>

                <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Our Instructions</h4>
              <ol>

                <li>Combine lemon and 4 cups water in a large bowl. Place the sliced apples in the water to keep them
                  from
                  browning.</li>

                <li>Overhead of apple slices in a bowl with lemon juice and water added.

                  Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain water from apples, and place them into the hot
                  skillet. Cook and stir for about 2 minutes.</li>

                <li> Add brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.</li>

                <li> Overhead of brown sugar being stirred in with apple slices cooking on a skillet.

                  Stir together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Pour into the skillet and mix well. Cook for another
                  minute, or until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat to cool slightly.</li>

                <li> Overhead of cooking apple slices and sauces cooking in a skillet.

                  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

                <li>Unfold puff pastry sheets, and repair any cracks by pressing them back together. Trim each sheet
                  into a
                  square.</li>

                <li>Overehead of puff pastry sheets being rolled flat and trimmed with a knife.

                  Then cut each larger square into 4 smaller squares. Spoon apples onto the center of each square. Fold
                  over from corner to corner into a triangle shape, and press edges together to seal.</li>

                <li>Overhead of cooked apple slices bing placed and folded into puff pastry sheets.

                  Place turnovers on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them.</li>

                <li> Overhead of folded apple turnovers being placed on a baking sheet.

                  Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until turnovers are puffed and lightly browned. Cool
                  completely before glazing.</li>

                <li> To make the glaze: Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Adjust the
                  thickness by adding more sugar or milk if necessary.</li>

                <li>Drizzle glaze over the cooled turnovers.</li>

                <li>Overhead of apple turnovers on a wire cooling rack as a glaze is spooned over them.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>

              <h2>Our Instructions</h2>
              <ol>
                Instructions
                <li>Begin by cutting 1/4" butter off the end of each of the 4 sticks in the pound; you'll have
                  about 2 tablespoons butter. Set them (and the remaining butter) aside. You'll be using the 2
                  tablespoons
                  butter immediately, but won't need the remaining butter until after you've made the dough.</li>

                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and cardamom. Add the 2
                  tablespoons cold butter, working it in with your fingers until no large lumps remain. This step coats
                  the flour a bit with fat, making the pastry a tiny bit more tender.</li>

                <li>Add the vanilla, milk, water, and eggs. Mix and knead to make a cohesive, but quite sticky
                  dough. This is easily done in a bread machine set on the dough cycle; or in a mixer. If you use a
                  mixer,
                  the dough won't completely clean the bowl; it'll probably leave a narrow ring around the side, and
                  stick
                  at the bottom.</li>

                <li>Scrape the dough into a ball, and transfer it to a floured work surface. Cover it with plastic wrap,
                  and
                  let it rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the butter.</li>


                <li>Cut each stick of butter in half lengthwise, to make 8 long rectangles. On a piece of floured
                  parchment
                  or plastic wrap, line up 4 of the butter pieces side by side, to form a rectangle. Sprinkle lightly
                  with
                  flour, and cover with another piece of parchment or plastic wrap.</li>

                <li>Gently pound and roll the butter until it's about 6" x 9". The pieces may or may not meld together.
                  If
                  they do, great, they'll be easier to work with. If not, though, that's OK; don't stress about it.</li>

                <li>Repeat with the remaining 4 pieces of butter. You should now have two butter rectangles, about 6" x
                  9"
                  each.</li>

                <li>Roll the dough into a rectangle about 12" wide and 24" long. Don't worry about being ultra-precise;
                  this
                  is just a guide, though you should try to get fairly close.

                <li>Place one of the butter pieces onto the center third of the dough. Fold one side over the butter to
                  cover it. Place the other butter piece atop the folded-over dough, and fold the remaining dough up
                  over
                  it. You now have a rectangular "packet" of dough-enclosed butter. Pinch the open ends and side closed
                  as
                  best you can.</li>

                <li>Turn the dough 90°, so a 12" side is closest to you. Roll the dough into a 10" x 24" rectangle
                  (approximately). Fold each side into the center; then fold one side over the other to make a
                  rectangular
                  packet about 6" x 10".</li>

                <li>Dust the surface of the dough with flour, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for
                  about 20 minutes.</li>

                <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, and again roll it into a rectangle about 10" x 24". Fold it into a
                  packet as you did in step #10; it'll be about 7" x 12". Roll one final time, fold into a packet, and
                  flour the dough lightly. Wrap loosely (but completely) in plastic, and chill it for 2 hours, or up to
                  16
                  hours; we prefer the longer refrigeration, as it gives the dough a chance to relax and rise.</li>

                <li>Before shaping the pastries, select your filling(s). We like to use a variety. Either of the filling
                  suggestions in this recipe make enough to fill all the pastries; so if you want to mix and match, make
                  a
                  half-recipe of the cheese filling, and use only half the amount of fruit filling called for.</li>

                <li>To make the cheese filling, combine all of the ingredients, stirring until smooth. For the smoothest
                  filling, process in a food processor.</li>

                <li>When you're ready to make pastries, remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and cut off
                  one-third. You'll work with this piece first; return the remainder to the fridge.</li>

                <li>Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Roll each into a smooth ball, then flatten the balls into 3" to 3
                  1/2"
                  rounds, making the center thinner than the edges. You want to build up a slight wall of dough all
                  around
                  the circumference; this will help hold the filling. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined or lightly
                  greased baking sheet.</li>

                <li>Working with one-half of the remaining dough at a time, repeat the process; you'll finish with three
                  baking sheets, each with 12 dough rounds.</li>

                <li>Cover the Danish lightly with greased plastic wrap, and let them rise for about 1 hour; they'll
                  become
                  slightly puffy. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>

                <li>Use your fingers to press the centers of the dough rounds as flat as possible, leaving the
                  "sidewalls"
                  puffed. Spoon a slightly heaping measuring teaspoon of filling into the well of each round.</li>

                <li>Brush the exposed edges of pastry with the egg/water topping; this will create a satiny, golden
                  crust.</li>

                <li>Bake the pastries for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and
                  transfer to a rack. Glaze and serve immediately; or wait until they cool, then glaze.</li>

                <li> To make the glaze, whisk the confectioners' sugar and salt with enough water or milk to make a
                  "drizzle-able" glaze.</li>

                <li> Drizzle the glaze atop the pastries. Sprinkle with crushed nuts.</li>

                <h3>Our Instructions</h3>
                <ol>

                  <h4>Step 1</h4>
                  <li>Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
                    attachment or an electric hand mixer, beat the butter, both sugars and vanilla on medium-high till
                    it’s super light and fluffy (3 to 5 minutes for a stand mixer; 6 to 8 for a hand mixer). Using a
                    spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour,
                    followed
                    by the chocolate chunks, and mix just to blend. If necessary, knead the dough with your hands to
                    make
                    sure the flour is totally incorporated. At this point, the dough should be smooth and feel like
                    Play-Doh with no pockets of flour.</li>

                  <h4>Step 2</h4>
                  <li>Divide the dough in half, placing each half on a large piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic
                    over so
                    that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands, form the
                    dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but don’t worry about
                    getting it totally perfect. (Don't be afraid to make them compact. Shortbread is supposed to be
                    dense.
                    That's part of why it's so good.) You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but
                    plastic wrap is easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form a 6-inch log, 2 to 2¼
                    inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.</li>

                  <h4>Step 3</h4>
                  <li> Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the outside of the logs with the beaten egg and roll them in
                    the
                    demerara sugar (this is for those really delicious, crisp edges).</li>

                  <h4>Step 4</h4>
                  <li>Using a serrated knife, carefully slice each log into ½-inch-thick rounds (if you hit a chocolate
                    chunk, slowly saw back and forth through the chocolate). If the cookies break or fall apart, just
                    press them back together — the dough is very forgiving. Place them on the prepared baking sheets
                    about
                    1 inch apart (they won’t spread much). Sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the edges are just
                    beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating them all.</li>

                  <h2>TIPS</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The cookie dough can be made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the
                      refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer. Cookies can be baked and stored in plastic wrap or an
                      airtight container for 5 days.</li>
                    <li>If you have Alison's book, you might notice a ¼ cup discrepancy in the volume measurement of
                      flour.
                      That's because NYT Cooking uses a different standard metric cup measurement. Alison uses 145
                      grams; we
                      use 128 grams.</li>

            </ol>

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>

              <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.</li>

              <li>To make the dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, mix together all the
                ingredients (except the butter) to make a smooth, stretchy dough that cleans the sides of the bowl; this
                should take 7 to 10 minutes at medium speed.</li>

              <li>Once the dough has developed some strength and elasticity, add one piece of the butter and mix at
                medium speed until it’s fully incorporated into the dough, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the bowl if necessary,
                then continue adding the butter one piece at a time, mixing to incorporate fully before adding the next
                piece. This dough takes longer than most to develop so be prepared to let the dough knead for another 5
                to 10 minutes, or until it's formed a soft, smooth ball. We don't recommend trying to knead this dough
                by hand.</li>

              <li>Form the dough into a ball (it'll be very soft), place it in a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and it
                let rise for 1 hour. Then refrigerate the dough for several hours, or overnight. This will slow the
                fermentation and chill the butter, making the dough easier to shape.</li>


              <li>Divide the chilled dough into 12 pieces to make mini-brioche (brioche buns); leave it whole for one
                large round brioche; or divide it in half for two 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaves.</li>

              <li>Place the dough into the greased pan(s) of your choice, cover lightly, and let rise for 2 1/2 to 3
                hours, until it's doubled and looks very puffy. If you're making two loaves, it's fun to make simple
                three-strand braids, and set them in the loaf pans.</li>

              <li>To bake a large, round brioche: Place the pan into a preheated 400°F oven. After 10 minutes, reduce
                the oven heat to 350°F and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes more. Check the brioche after 15 minutes;
                tent with aluminum foil if it appears to be browning too quickly. Brioche should be a deep brown when
                done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will read 190°F at the center using an instant-read
                thermometer. (It's easy to underbake since it browns so quickly!) Remove the brioche from the oven, and
                after 10 minutes remove it from the pan to cool completely on a rack.</li>

              <li>To bake the mini brioches: Place the pan(s) onto a baking sheet for easy handling, as shown; then
                nestle that baking sheet into another baking sheet, to protect the buns' bottoms from over-browning.
                Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes (tent after 10 minutes if they're browning
                too quickly). Remove them from the oven, let stand for 5 minutes, then turn them out onto a rack.</li>

              <li>vTo bake the loaves: Allow the loaves to rise until they've nearly reached the rim of the pan, about 3
                hours. Set the loaf pans on a baking sheet, for easy handling. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 to
                35 minutes, tenting with foil after 15 to 20 minutes. Bake until the internal temperature reaches at
                least 190°F in the center, and up to 205°F for a crustier loaf.</li>

              <li>To make the glaze: Combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt. Add enough cream to make a
                pourable consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the baked loaves, if desired.</li>

              <h2>Tips from our Bakers</h2>
              If you're baking the brioche as a braided loaf, add an extra yolk to the dough, reserving the white.
              Just before baking the risen loaves, whisk the reserved white with 1 tablespoon milk, brush on loaves,
              and sprinkle with pearl sugar or sparkling white sugar.
              What if you don't have a stand mixer or bread machine to knead this brioche dough? Since we don't feel
              this recipe produces acceptable results when kneaded by hand, please try our Strawberry Swirl No-Knead
              Brioche. For plain brioche, simply shape the dough into a log and place it in the pan, leaving out the
              strawberry filling.

                Ingredients
                <ol>

                  <li>1 tablespoon (9g) instant yeast</li>
                  <li>4 cups (480g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li>
                  <li>2 teaspoons (12g) salt</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon (9g) non-diastatic malt powder or 1 tablespoon (14g) dark brown sugar, or barley
                    malt syrup</li>
                  <li>1 1/3 cups (303g) water, lukewarm</li>


                  <h4>Water bath</h4>
                  <li>2 quarts (1814g) water</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons (18g) non-diastatic malt powder or 2 tablespoons (28g) dark brown sugar, or barley
                    malt syrup</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon (14g) granulated sugar</li>

                  <ol>

                    <h4>Our Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>

                      <li>
                        Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
                        Combine all of the dough ingredients and knead vigorously for 10 minutes (if you're using an
                        electric mixer) or up to 15 minutes (if you're kneading by hand). Since we're using a
                        high-protein
                        bread flour here, it takes a bit more effort and time to develop the gluten. The dough will be
                        quite
                        stiff; if you're using a mixer it will "thwap" the sides of the bowl, and hold its shape
                        (without
                        spreading at all) when you stop the mixer.</li>

                      <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and set it aside to rise until it's
                        noticeably
                        puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>

                      <li>Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line them with parchment and grease the parchment.
                        Transfer the
                        dough to a work surface, and divide it into eight pieces (for large bagels), or 12 pieces (for
                        standard-size bagels).</li>

                      <li>Working with one piece at a time, roll it into a smooth, round ball. Place the balls on one of
                        the
                        prepared baking sheets. Cov</li>


                      <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the water bath by heating the water, non-diastatic malt
                        powder
                        (or brown sugar or barley malt syrup), and sugar to a very gentle boil in a large, wide-diameter
                        pan. Preheat your oven to 425°F.</li>


                      <li>Use your index finger to poke a hole through the center of each ball, then twirl the dough on
                        your
                        finger to stretch the hole until it's about 1 1/2" to 2" in diameter. Place six bagels on each
                        of
                        the baking sheets.</li>

                      <li>transfer the bagels, four at a time if possible, to the simmering water. Increase the heat
                        under the
                        pan to bring the water back up to a gently simmering boil, if necessary. Cook the bagels for 2
                        minutes, flip them over, and cook 1 minute more. Using a skimmer or strainer, remove the bagels
                        from
                        the water and place them back on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bagels.</li>

                      <li>Bake the bagels for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're as deep brown as you like, turning them
                        over
                        about 15 minutes into the baking time (this will help them remain tall and round). Remove the
                        bagels
                        from the oven, and cool completely on a rack.></li>

                    <h4>Tips from our Bakers</h4>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Bake it better! Watch King Arthur baker/blogger Kye Ameden demonstrate one of the techniques
                        from
                        this recipe: How to Shape Bagels</li>

                      <li>To make onion-topped bagels, bake bagels for 20 to 22 minutes (or until they're almost as
                        brown as
                        you like), and remove the pan from the oven, keeping the oven turned on. Working with one bagel
                        at a
                        time, glaze as instructed above, and sprinkle with minced, dried onion. Return the bagels to the
                        oven for no more than 2 minutes (the onions will burn if the bagels are left in longer than
                        that).
                        Want to make cinnamon-raisin bagels? Knead about 2/3 cup of raisins into the dough toward the
                        end of
                        the kneading process. Just before you're done kneading, sprinkle your work surface heavily with
                        cinnamon-sugar, and give the dough a few more turns; it'll pick up the cinnamon-sugar in
                        irregular
                        swirls. Divide the dough into pieces, form each piece into a ball, and roll each ball in
                        additional
                        cinnamon-sugar. Proceed to let rest and shape as directed above.
                        Variations: To make sesame seed or poppy seed (or other seed) bagels, brush each bagel, just
                        before
                        baking, with a glaze made of 1 egg white beaten until frothy with 1 tablespoon of water. Glaze
                        each
                        bagel, and sprinkle heavily with seeds.
                        Want to add a bit of tang to your bagels? Mix a scant 1/2 cup (100g) fed (ripe) or unfed
                        (discard)
                        sourdough starter with the rest of the ingredients, reducing the water in the recipe to 1 cup +
                        2
                        tablespoons (255g).</li>
